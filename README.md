# Cryptography Implementations

A comprehensive collection of cryptographic algorithms implemented as part of a university cryptography course. This repository includes implementations of AES (with multiple modes), ECC, and Trivium stream cipher.

## üîë Algorithms

### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- Multiple modes of operation:
  - Electronic Codebook (ECB)
  - Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
  - Cipher Feedback (CFB)
  - Output Feedback (OFB)
  - Counter Mode (CTR)

### Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
- Basic ECC operations
- Key generation and exchange
- Point operations on elliptic curves

### Trivium Stream Cipher
- Lightweight stream cipher
- Key stream generation
- Encryption/Decryption functionality

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8+ (AES implementation)
- C++ Compiler (ECC implementation)
- Python 3.8+ (Trivium implementation)

### Building and Running

Each algorithm has its own directory with specific build instructions. See the respective README files in each directory.
